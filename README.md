# SaltshakerBT-Decomp
A actual "Decompile" of What's Shakin Bacon?

GameMaker Version Used: ```Latest Gamemaker Beta.```

Packages that it has:
- Gameframe
- GMLive
- GifHx
- GMEXT FMOD v1.0.9
- Retro Palette Swapper
- rtShell
- NekoPresence

### Problems
- Icons dont appear correctly as its being called for. (possibly Draw_textEX related.... i guess)
- Gameframe's alpha is fucked up
there might be more problems for this decomp, 
but you can put up a issue if you find one.
